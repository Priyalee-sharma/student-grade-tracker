- Calculate average grades per student
- Display all stored student information
- Simple console-based user interaction
- Object-Oriented Design using Java classes

## 💡 How It Works

1. Users (teachers/admins) can input student names and their grades per subject.
2. The app stores each student’s grades using data structures like maps/lists.
3. The user can then retrieve:
   - All students and their grades
   - Each student's average
   - Students who passed/failed (if applicable)

StudentGradeTracker tracker = new StudentGradeTracker();
tracker.addGrade("Priya", "Math", 85);
tracker.addGrade("Priya", "Science", 78);
tracker.displayGrades("Priya");
